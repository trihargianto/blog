## Preface

When we get a new role after a promotion, we often want to make a significant impact right away to prove our suitability for the position to our managers. Some people have creative minds and can achieve this immediately, which undoubtedly pleases their managers.

However, not everyone is blessed with such creativity. Some people might be uncertain about what to do after their promotion and may end up making poor decisions in an attempt to impress.

## Align the Expectations

In such situations, instead of immediately thinking about what should change within the company, I prefer to ask the managers for a detailed job description for the new role.

When I say "ask," I mean you should clarify the job description thoroughly. Ask the managers about:

- The company vision and team mission.
- The main objectives of the role.
- The exact job description and routine tasks for the role.
- The metrics used to measure the role’s performance.

You don't need to make a big impact right away. Start by doing the job based on the initial expectations.

## Conduct Regular 1on1 Meetings

The next step is to ensure you and your manager have regular one-on-one meetings to check whether you are meeting their expectations. Typically, the manager will schedule these meetings, but if they don’t, you should proactively request them.

## Improve Your Work

Once you know that your work aligns with and meets the expectations, look for ways to improve it. This phase is not about merely meeting expectations again, but about going beyond them to perform above expectations.

## Recap

- Start by doing the job according to expectations.
- Don’t worry if you don’t make a big impact initially. You'll find opportunities for improvement as you progress. Time will tell.
- Regularly hold one-on-one meetings to check whether you’re meeting your manager’s expectations.
- Continuously improve your work to move from “meeting expectations” to “exceeding expectations.”
