# About Me

Hello, I'm Tri Hargianto. I'm a Software Engineer working in Yogyakarta,
Indonesia. Welcome to my digital garden where I put my projects, tutorials,
thoughts, and anything else I want to show to the world.

Check out my [Pet Projects](/pet-projects) page to see some highlights of my
open-source work, my [Blog](/blog) for tutorials & my thoughts, and lastly my
[Publications](/publications) page where I put links to my publications on some
platforms. My motivation for this site is to share what I've learned with the
world.

## What I'm doing now

_Updated January 13th, 2024_

Currently I'm a Tech Lead in [Mamikos.com](https://mamikos.com) for frontend
team and also working on my several projects including everything you see in
this site.

## Random facts

- I had my first PC and learned programming with PHP in 2013.
- I'm a partial color blind. That's why I made
  [Camera Color Picker](https://camera-color-picker.vercel.app/).
- I'm also a web programming instructor freelancer and already teach more than
  60 students.
- This site was first released in 2020 and fully inspired by
  [taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/).
